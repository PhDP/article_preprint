Dear Editors,

I would like to submit, on behalf of my co-authors, a proposal for an opinion
paper entitled “Public preprints in ecology and evolution” for consideration
in X. The manuscript is authored by myself, Ethan White, Timothée Poisot, ...,
and Dominique Gravel.

// Here, you need to add a full disclosure, in case some of us are associated
with one of the preprints solutions we discuss in the text. Is Dom a F1000
member?

Public preprint servers such as arXiv.org allow researchers to make public
their research while it is undergoing peer-review. These servers are
increasingly seen as an important component of open science: the manuscripts
can be discussed by the scientific community as soon as they are finished
instead of being hidden until officially published. The quantitative biology
section of arXiv is growing faster than any other section, yet there is still
much to do to promote this practice in ecology and evolution.

// A lot of papers on epidemiology, this might be worth mentionning

In this opinion piece, we will make the argument for public preprints servers
and discuss their current status in ecology and evolution. The article will be
structured as follows:

1. The case for public preprints. In this first section, we make the case for
   submitting preprints to public servers. We argue that this practice is
   beneficial to both scientists and publishers and emphasize how it can be
   part of a vigorous peer-review process.

2. Preprints, ecology and evolution. We discuss the current state of preprints
   in ecology & evolution and the policies of the main publishers.
 
3. The current offer. Finally, we discuss the main options to submit
   preprints. We briefly review arXiv, figshare, and the upcoming PeerJ and
   F1000Research.

// You need to say, in a few words, why the paper is suited to the journal,
who we want to adress with it, and why it is timely. Even if most of the infos
are already in the first paragraph, say it again.

We look forward to your decision.

Best regards,
On behalf of the authors,

Philippe Desjardins-Proulx
