\section{Introduction}

Public preprint servers allow authors to make manuscripts publicly available
before, or in parallel to, submitting them to journals for traditional
peer-review. The rationale for preprint servers is fundamentally simple: to make
the results available to the scientific community as soon as possible rather
than to wait until the peer-review process is fully completed. The goal of arXiv
and open preprint servers is not to avoid the peer-review process; almost all
manuscripts on arXiv are submitted to peer-review.  Sharing ideas as quickly as
possible using preprint servers has numerous advantages.  These include rapid
dissemination of work in progress to a wider audience, including readers in
developing countries where access to subscription journals is often a limiting
factor in scientific research.  Furthermore, preprints provide the opportunity
to solicit feedback from a larger pool of reviewers and can be seen as an
integral aspect of a vigorous peer-review process \cite{hoc12}.  Preprint
servers therefore increase the number of opportunities for review and revision
prior to publication, resulting in higher quality submissions and also could
alleviate reviewer burden.

Preprints gained popularity 20 years ago with the advent of arXiv, an open
preprint server widely used in physics and mathematics \cite{gin11}. Preprints
are also integral to the culture of other scientific fields.  Paul Krugman noted
that, in economics, the \emph{traditional model of submit, get refereed,
publish, and then people will read your work broke down a long time ago. In
fact, it had more or less fallen apart by the early 80s} \cite{kru12}. In
addition to a section in arXiv, economists have also the RePEc (Research Papers
in Economics) initiative, which aims to create an archive of working papers,
manuscripts, and book chapters.  Despite the success of this approach in other
fields, most manuscripts in biology are not submitted to a public archive before
being submitted to peer-review.  In this article, we will first highlight the
advantages of open preprint servers for both scientists and publishers. We will
also debunk a few misconceptions, discuss the policies of major publishers in
biology, and briefly review the most popular open preprint servers.

\section{The case for public preprints}

The first and most often discussed advantage of arXiv and open preprints is
speed (Figure~\ref{fig:map}). The time between submission and the official
publication of a manuscript can be measured in months, sometime in years. For
all this time, the research is known only to a select few: colleagues, editors,
reviewers.  Thus, the science cannot be used, discussed, or reviewed by the
wider scientific community.  This stage of manuscript preparation is a problem
for both scientists and publishers.  Manuscripts that are unknown cannot be used
and thus take more time to be cited. It has been shown that high-energy physics,
with its high arXiv submission rate, had the highest immediacy among physics and
mathematics \cite{pra05}. Immediacy measures how quickly articles are cited. 

Furthermore, the review process as a whole is critically over-loaded, because as
the number of active scientists increases, because the pressure to publish
increases, and because of an effect dubbed ``the tragedy of the reviewers
commons'' REF.  At the same time, rejection rates are high in most journals
(REF), and when not invited to submit a revision, authors must start the whole
process all over again.  Initiatives to reduce time from submission to
publication have emerged across the scientific community XXX et coll.  (REF)
called for the recycling and reuse of peer-reviews: by attaching previous
reviews and detailed replies to a new submission, both the editor and the
referees can gauge the work done on the manuscript, and perhaps evaluate it with
less prejudice. In a similar way, the \emph{Peerage of Science} initiative
allows authors to seek anonymous pre-review by their peers. Some journals now
accept to publish papers which received good evaluations, with \emph{Animal
Biology} having recently accepted first a paper reviewed entirely with the
\emph{Peerage of Science} \cite{abb12}, effectively outsourcing the review
process. A widespread use of preprint servers can achieve the same goal of
reducing the time spent in review. By putting a manuscript for open comments and
criticisms, the authors will receive valuable feedback and can improve the
version which will be submitted. With a rich enough community of scientists
depositing preprints, and commenting on them, the process of an open pre-review
can become widespread and will overall increase the quality of first
submissions.

\begin{figure}[ht!] \centering\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{map.pdf}
\caption { It can take several months, and even a few years, before a submitted
paper is officially published and citable.  The average time to publication
varies greatly between journals and can be as low as 104 days (Evolution for
2011) to 213 (PLOS One in 2010).  Meanwhile, few people are aware of the
research that has been done since, typically, only close colleagues are given
access to the preprints. With public preprint servers, the science is
immediately available and can be openly discussed, analyzed, and integrated into
current research. It benefits both science and publishers. Both want the papers
to be well-known and cited, and public preprints make it possible to integrate
research even before publication, greatly improving immediacy.  }
\label{fig:map} \end{figure}

Public preprint servers offer a much fairer way to establish intellectual
priority by making the work available when done. Some manuscripts will spend
much more time in the review process than others. Surprisingly, there is a
perception in biology that public preprints make it easier to steal ideas, as if
a scientific idea was only complete once published in a peer-reviewed journal
\cite{gin11}. Ironically, mathematicians and physicists have embraced arXiv in
part to establish priority in a fair way \cite{gin11,cal12}.

Prepublication reviews by a small network of colleagues is an important part of
the scientific process, attested by the fact that nearly all published papers
acknowledge comments by people not listed as co-authors.  Preprint servers
simply offer a way to extend this network of colleagues to the entire scientific
community. It ensures that science is not constrained by small networks of
scientists exchanging ideas.  Paul Ginsparg created arXiv.org in part for
democratic reasons: he wanted everyone from students in small universities to
Ivy-League professors to have access to the most recent scientific \emph{ideas}.
Ginsparg's revolutionary idea was simply to use the power of the internet for
preprints, not just for the end product, so the scientific process can be open
as soon as possible.

\section{Preprints in biological sciences}

Submitting to a preprint server is becoming more common in biology, even though
it still involves a minority of papers. The quantitative biology section in
arXiv is experiencing faster growth in submissions than any other field
\cite{cal12}. Most scientific journals are preprint-friendly: Nature, PLOS, BMC,
PNAS, Science (mostly) \ref{table:policies}, and all the journals from Elsevier
and Springer.  The Ecological Society of America and the Genetics Society of
America recently changed their policies to allow public preprints.  Few
scientific publications will not consider a manuscript submitted to a public
preprint server.  Still, a few journals adopt a ``by default'' hostile attitude
towards preprints, mostly due to the lack of clear policy of the publishers, or
perhaps because a preprint culture has not developed in biology and the practice
is still considered unusual. As an example, Wiley-Blackwell, which publishes
some leading journals, has no official policy on the subject
\ref{table:policies}.

Part of the hostility to preprints servers comes from a certain interpretation
of the Ingelfinger rule: scientists should not publish the same manuscript twice
\cite{alt96}. However, papers submitted to arXiv or other preprints servers are
only published in one peer-reviewed journal. A preprint is just a preprint, it
is a document that allows ideas to spread and be discussed, but it is not yet
formally validated by the peer-review system, which is why the majority of
publishers does not see arXiv and similar services as a violation of the
Ingelfinger rule. \emph{Nature} responded to the rumour that they refused
manuscripts submitted to arXiv by saying that ``\emph{Nature} never wishes to
stand in the way of communication between researchers. We seek rather to add
value for authors and the community at large in our peer review, selection and
editing'' \cite{nat05}.

\section{Current offerings}

We briefly discuss the main options to submit preprints to open servers:
arXiv.org, Figshare, and the upcoming PeerJ and F1000Research.

\subsection{arXiv}

arXiv (\url{http://arxiv.org/}) is the most widely-used preprint server today,
and its use is almost universal in some branches of mathematics and physics.
arXiv provides a reliable citation system for all eprints and is especially
popular in high-energy physics. Physicist Paul Ginsparg created arXiv in 1991
for theoretical high-energy physicists to communicate preprints via email and
ftp, and soon thereafter adopted the newly created world-wide
web\cite{jackson2002preprints}.  arXiv now receives over 7 000 submissions per
month (\url{http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions}) and divides its
submissions into subcategories of physics, mathematics, computer science,
quantitative biology, finance and statistics.  The quantitative biology category
includes subcategories for Populations and Evolution, Quantitative Methods and
other categories that may be of interest to biologists.

Submission to arXiv is fully automated.  Authors can submit \TeX{}/\LaTeX{}
documents that are compiled on the server or directly submit in PDF/PS format
(for example, as exported by a word processor).  A moderation system was put in
place in 2004: papers must be categorized by an endorser. At least one author of
a paper must be an endorser that has previously submitted a paper or has
received permission to submit to a particular category.  Many authors in
mathematics and physics submit papers as soon as they are ready for review by
colleagues, although another popular option is submitting simultaneously to a
journal and arXiv.

Authors must either have their arXiv submission available under an open license
or grant arXiv a non-exclusive and irrevocable license to distribute the work.
In either case, arXiv does not require copyright transfer and only requires the
rights to distribute submitted articles in perpetuity. Thus, submitting to arXiv
does not in itself prevent the authors from transferring their rights to a
publisher, which is why most publishers tolerate arXiv, even though they ask the
authors to transfer their right to them upon acceptance of the article.

Most papers posted to arXiv are eventually printed in journals but there are
notable exceptions, such as Perelman's landmark paper leading to the proof of
the Poincar\'{e} conjecture \cite{2002math.....11159P}.  However, arXiv has
never sought to replace scientific journals and explicitly states that it serves
a different function as ``an openly accessible, moderated repository for
scholarly articles in specific scientific disciplines.'' arXiv is now
administered by the Cornell University Libraries, with funding coming from
voluntary pledges by academic institutions along with matching funds from the
Simons Foundation \cite{arxiv_future}.  One-hundred twenty six of the top
two-hundred institutions in terms of downloads have provided the operating
budget for arXiv over the next five years.  This plan reduces the financial
burden on Cornell University and transfers governance to a collaborative
community in accordance with arXiv's key principles.  arXiv takes numerous
measures to ensure that the repository will remain permanently available and
submissions will be readable.

\subsection{Figshare}

Figshare (\href{http://figshare.com/}{http://figshare.com/}) is an open server
that allows scientists to submit any research output: manuscript, figures,
datasets, videos, theses, presentations, and so on. There are no rules to limit
what constitutes a research output and, unlike arXiv, there is no endorser
system. All figshare content has a unique digital object identifier (DOI) like
any journal article, thus offering a permanent and stable link to the content.
A flexible tag system is used to classify each item. All content can be
commented and is licensed under the Creative Commons (CC-BY) license, except
datasets which are published under CC0. The CC-BY license grants rights to
\emph{copy, distribute, display and perform the work and make derivative works
based on it only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner
specified by these.}  CC0 is the most permissive license and effectively puts
the work in public domain (no rights reserved) or, if it is not possible in the
given jurisdiction, provides a simple permissive license.

One of the biggest advantage of figshare over arXiv is that is it not limited to
quantitative sciences. arXiv.org has sections on quantitative biology but might
not be appropriate for non-quantitative work. With its flexible approach to
preprints, figshare offers an important alternative to arXiv for empirical
biologists. Furthermore, by allowing all types of content, figshare arguably
provides an archive for early results (e.g.: figures, lab presentations).

\subsection{PeerJ}

PeerJ (\href{https://peerj.com/}{https://peerj.com/}) is a new publishing system
that provides both a preprint server, and a peer reviewed journal.  It is
focused on the biological and medical sciences, which may help overcome the
perception that preprints do not have a home in biology.  PeerJ allows
commenting on posted preprints, improving the potential for pre-publication
dialog. In addition, preprints can be made private if the authors choose, and
shared only with selected colleagues. While this reduces some of the benefits of
preprints described above, it may allow some researchers who would not otherwise
post preprints to begin to explore the possibility in a manner appropriate to
their current circumstances.

In contrast to other preprint servers users cannot post unlimited public
preprints for free. One preprint per year can be posted for free and a onetime
(i.e. lifetime) fee of 99 dollars allows the posting of unlimited public
preprints. It is also worth noting that the preprint server is not tied to the
journal, so preprints can be posted regardless of where they will eventually be
submitted for publication.

PeerJ uses the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license, which is similar to the CC-BY license used
by Figshare but adds the \emph{Share-alike} (sa) restriction that derivate works
need a license identical to the license that governs the original work.

\subsection{F1000Research}

F1000Research is not a public preprint server like the previous three servers.
Whereas arXiv, Figshare, and PeerJ offer an option to submit a manuscript
without having it reviewed, papers submitted to F1000Research will eventually be
reviewed. Thus, F1000Research offers a hybrid model with publicly available
manuscripts at time of submission and standard peer-reviews. Manuscripts are
considered ``accepted'' and will only be indexed after two positive referee
response.

\subsection{Github et al.?}

This manuscript was developed entirely as an open project on github. github is
one of several hosting services for collaborative development using the git
revision control software.  git is a decentralized revision control system
created by Linus Torvalds and is used primarily to develop software, including
the Linux kernel. It allows the users to share code, track changes, and merge
versions. For example, during the development of this manuscript, one author
would fork the project (i.e.: make a personal copy), modify it, and then the
changes were merged back into the main branch. These techniques are widely used
in open source software development. It goes even farther than submitting
preprints by opening the entire writing process.

\section{Conclusion}

Open preprint servers offer a great opportunity for open science, especially if
the community embraces the idea of discussing preprints. Initiatives like
Haldane's Sieve (\href{http://haldanessieve.org/}{http://haldanessieve.org/}), a
new blog discussing arXiv papers in population genetics, will help make arXiv
attractive for scientists looking to promote their work. These initiatives are
important to fully exploit the potential of open preprints servers. Posting
preprints online increases the community of available informal peer reviewers,
and uses the internet for its original community-building purposes.

Preprint servers also facilitate communication between disciplines, bridging
cultural as well as geographic divides. Examples include a recent series of
papers on the theory of natural selection that was posted to arXiv
simultaneously with its publication in the \emph{Journal of Evolutionary
Biology} \cite{JEB:JEB2431,JEB:JEB2498,JEB:JEB2378,JEB:JEB2373}. Other
submissions in this category include evolutionary and ecological theory by
authors trained in physics and computer science.  Since authors in these fields
regularly check arXiv, submitting preprints may be the most effective way
biologists can help others avoid ``repeated work'' \cite{de2011contribution} and
form a synthetic community of evolutionary theorists from disparate backgrounds.
The advantages are clear and the costs are low.
