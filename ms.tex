\section{Introduction}

Open preprints servers allow authors to make their manuscripts publicly available before, or in parallel to, submitting them to journals for traditional peer-review. This idea gained popularity 20 years ago with the advent of arXiv, an open preprint server, widely used in the physical sciences \cite{gin11}. The idea behind pre-print servers is fundamentally simple: to make the results of a scientific endavour available to the scientific community as soon as possible rather than wait until the peer-review process is fully completed. The point of arXiv and open preprints servers is not to avoid the peer-review process. Almost all manuscripts on arXiv are submitted to peer-review.  Sharing drafts of research papers on pre-print servers has numerous advantages. These include rapid dissemination of work in progress to a wider audience that includes not only scientists and the general public, but also readers in developing countries where access to subscription journals are often a limiting factor. Further, pre-prints provide the opportunity to solicit feedback from a larger pool of reviewers. As a consequence, pre print servers increase the number of opportunities for review and revision prior to publication, resulting in higher quality submissions which could also alleviate reviewer burden.

In this article, we will first highlight the advantages of open preprints
servers for both scientists and publishers. We will also debunk a few
misconceptions, discuss the policies of major publishers in ecology an
evolution, and briefly review the most popular open preprint servers.

\section{The case for open preprints}

The first and most often discussed advantage of arXiv and open preprints is
speed \ref{fig:map}. The time between submission and the official publication of
a manuscript can be measured in months, sometime in years. For all this time,
the research is only known to a select few: colleagues, editors, reviewers.
Thus, the science cannot be used, discussed, or reviewed by the wider scientific
community. ...

%% Allows papers to be cited earlier (greater immediacy)

The review process as a whole is critically over-loaded, because the
number of active scientists increases, because the pressure to publish
increases, and because of an effect dubbed ``the tragedy of the
reviewers commons'' REF.  At the same time, rejection rates are high
in most journals (REF), and when not invited to submit revisions,
authors are left with the impression that they must start the whole
process all over again. It's thus no surprise that different
initiatives emerged over the last few years to decrease the time spent
in review. XXX et coll. (REF) called for the recycling and reuse of
peer-reviews: by attaching previous reviews, and detailed replies, to
a new submission, both the editor and the referees can gauge the work
done on the manuscript, and perhaps evaluate it with less
prejudice. In a similar way, the \emph{Peerage of Science} initiative
allows authors to seek anonymous pre- review by their peers. Some
journals (LIST?) now accept papers for publication that received good
evaluations, effectively outsourcing the review process. A widespread
use of preprint servers can achieve the same goal of reducing the time
spent in review. By putting a manuscript out there for open comments
and criticisms, the authors will receive valuable feedback, and can
improve the version which will be submitted. With a rich enough
community of scientists depositing preprints, and commenting on them,
the process of an open pre- review can become widespread, and will
overall increase the quality of first submissions.
% Assuming that the quality of the paper is a good prior of its acceptance probability :-)

\begin{figure}[ht!] \centering\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{map.pdf}
\caption { It can take several months, and even a few years, before a submitted
paper is officially published and citable. During this time, few people are
aware of the research that has been done (typically, close colleagues are
given access to the preprints). With public preprint servers, the science is
immediately available and can be openly discussed, analysed, and integrated
into current research. It benefits both science and publishers. Both want the
papers to be well-known and cited, and public preprints make it possible to
integrate research even before publication, greatly improving immediacy.  }
\label{fig:map}
\end{figure}

Preprint servers also establish priority in a fair way.  Some
manuscripts will spend much more time in the review process than
others.  Public preprint servers offer a much fairer way to establish
intellectual priority by making the work available when done, even if
the exact organisation of the manuscript may change. Surprisingly,
there is a perception in biology that public preprints make it easier
to steal ideas, as if scientific ideas only took form in published
material.
% TP This needs more development, I'm not sure I get your point
Mathematicians and physicists have embraced arXiv in part to establish
priority in a fair way\cite{cal12}.

Some of the responses to public preprints are surprising since they are,
essentially, the same as exchanging preprints among colleagues.
% TP Well, no. You trust your colleagues, and you trust that they will
% not give your MS to anyone!
Prepublication reviews by a small network of colleagues is an
important part of the scientific process, which is attested by the
fact that nearly all published papers acknowledge comments by people
not listed as co-authors.  Preprint servers simply offer a way to
extend this network of colleagues to the entire scientific
community. It ensures that science is not constrained by small
networks of scientists exchanging ideas.  Paul Ginsparg created
arXiv.org in part for democratic reasons: he wanted everyone from
students in small universities to Ivy-League professors to have access
to the most recent scientific \emph{ideas}.
% TP One important point to make: the MS and the idea are different things.
%    We should focus more on the later...
Ginsparg's revolutionary idea was simply to use the power of the
internet for preprints, not just for the end product, so the process
can be open from A to Z, instead of being just open at the end of the
process.
% TP Since when is the publishing buisness an open process? :-)
% PhDP: Wishful thinking :) Corrected...

Preprint servers also establish priority in a fair way. Since some manuscripts
will spend much more time in the review process, public preprints servers offer
a fairer way to establish intellectual priority by making the work available
when done. Surprisingly, there is perception in biology that public preprints
make it easier to steal ideas, while mathematicians and physicists have embraced
arXiv in part to establish intellectual priority in a fair way \cite{cal12}.

\section{Preprints, Ecology \& Evolution}

While submitting to public preprints servers is still uncommon in ecology and
evolution, preprints are becoming more common in biological sciences. The
quantitative biology section in arXiv is experiencing faster growth in
submissions than any other fields \cite{cal12}. Also, most scientific journals
are preprint-friendly: Nature, PLOS, BMC, PNAS, Science (mostly)
\ref{table:policies}, and all the journals from Elsevier and Springer. Very
recently, the Ecological Society of America recently changed its policy to allow
public preprints (REF). In our field, few scientific publications will not
consider a manuscript submitted to arXiv.  Still, many ecology \& evolution
journals adopt a ``by default'' hostile attitude towards preprints, mostly due
to the lack of clear policy of the publishers. As an example, Wiley-Blackwell,
which publishes some of the leading journal in the field, has no official policy
on the subject \ref{table:policies}.

\begin{table*}

\end{table*}

There are other ``cultural'' barriers to adoption of preprint servers
by ecologists and evolutionary biologists.  The most notable preprint
server, arXiv, is designed to work best with \TeX{}, a nearly
universal document preparation system among physicists and
mathematicians.  Jackson \cite{jackson2002preprints} further argues
that \TeX{} introduced an ``open source mindset'' to its users, who
now freely share their research findings as well as their software.
Many biologists instead use proprietary software to prepare their
research findings, and many ecology and evolution journals officially
prefer Microsoft Word documents as submissions.  The recent
discipline-wide adoption of free software packages such as R and associated  document generation systems \cite{xie2012}, as well
as interest in open access publishing, has coincided with recent rise in use
of preprint servers by biologists, supporting Jackson's claims.

Physicists and other quantitative scientists have recently developed a
great interest in evolutionary theory, quantitative ecological theory
and epidemiological modeling.  Unfortunately this has led to a lot of
repeated work (``reinventing the wheel''; \cite{de2011contribution})
that could be avoided by better communication across disciplines.  The
near-universal adoption of preprint servers in physics provides this
vital communication channel.  We suggest that biologists reach out to
physicists and mathematicians by posting papers to arXiv: a physicist
who does not read \emph{Evolution} certainly checks arXiv at least
weekly.  This benefits both disciplines, as biologists will reach new
readers, and physicists will learn the terminology, tools and ideas
common in existing evolutionary theory.  A recent series of papers on
the theory of natural selection was posted to arXiv simultaneously
with its publication in the \emph{Journal of Evolutionary Biology}
\cite{JEB:JEB2431,JEB:JEB2498,JEB:JEB2378,JEB:JEB2373}.

\section{Current offerings}

We briefly discuss the main options to submit preprints to open servers:
arXiv.org, Figshare, and the upcoming PeerJ and F1000Research.

\subsection{arXiv}

% @Joel
% Rough outline:
% 1. Description of arXiv (origins, funding, maintenance)
% 2. Submission process
% 3. Role within math and physics community (nearly universal), including recent changes
% 4. Nature of citations and "priority"
%
% My biggest problem here is how to cite my sources: the information
% on funding comes from a press release from Cornell University
% Libraries; other basic "raw data" comes straight from the arXiv
% webpages. How do I cite that?

arXiv (\url{http://arxiv.org/}) is the most widely-used preprint
server today, and its use is almost universal in mathematics and most
branches of physics.  Physicist Paul Ginsparg originated arXiv in 1991
for theoretical high-energy physicists to communicate preprints via
email and ftp, and soon thereafter adopted the newly created
world-wide web\cite{jackson2002preprints}.  arXiv now receives over
7,000 submissions per month
(\url{http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions}).  arXiv divides its
submissions into subcategories of physics, mathematics, computer
science, quantitative biology, finance and statistics.  The
quantitative biology category includes subcategories for Populations
and Evolution, Quantitative Methods and other categories that may be
of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists.
% Check me on this @Pierre!  Not only is this vague, but I'm not sure
% how to verify it; I want to give people the impression that a
% "Quantitative ecology" or "General ecology" category could be
% created easily
The creation of new categories is regulated by the same system that
categorizes papers.

Submission to arXiv is fully automated via the world-wide web.
Authors can submit \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} documents or directly in PDF or
PostScript (for example, as exported by a word processor).  A
moderation system was put in place in 2004: papers must be categorized
by an ``endorser.''  At least one author of a paper must be an
endorser that has previously submitted a paper or has received
permission to submit to a particular category.  Many authors in
mathematics and physics submit papers as soon as they are ready for
review by colleagues, although another popular option is submitting
simultaneously to a journal and arXiv.

Most papers posted to arXiv are eventually printed in journals.  There
are notable exceptions, including Perelman's landmark paper leading to
the proof of the Poincar\'{e} conjecture \cite{2002math.....11159P}.
arXiv provides a reliable citation system for all eprints (see our
citation \cite{2002math.....11159P}), lending a form of ``intellectual
priority'' to works posted there.  Despite these marks of arXiv 
functioning as a scientific journal, arXiv has never sought to replace
scientific journals and explicitly states that it serves a different
function as ``an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly
articles in specific scientific disciplines.''

arXiv is now administered by the Cornell University Libraries.
Funding comes from voluntary pledges by academic institutions along
with matching funds from the Simons Foundation \cite{arxiv_future}.
One-hundred twenty six of the top two-hundred institutions in terms of
downloads have provided the operating budget for arXiv over the next
five years.  This plan reduces the financial burden on Cornell
University and transfers governance to a collaborative community in
accordance with arXiv's key principles.  arXiv takes numerous measures
to ensure that the repository will remain permanently available and
submissions will be readable.

\subsection{Figshare}

% @PhDP

Figshare (\href{http://figshare.com/}{http://figshare.com/}) is an open servers
that allow scientists to submit any research output: manuscript, figures,
datasets, videos, theses, presentations, and so on. There are no rules to limit
what constitutes a research output: anything

All figshare content (article, figures, datasets) have a unique digital object
identifier (DOI) like any journal article.

All content is licensed under the Creative Commons (CC-BY) license, except
datasets which are published under CC0.
% Small explanation

\subsection{PeerJ}

% @Ethan

\subsection{F1000Research}

% Written from memory: to verify!

F1000Research is not a public preprint server like the previous three servers.
Whereas arXiv, Figshare, and PeerJ offer an option to submit a manuscript
without having it reviewed, papers submitted to F1000Research will eventually be
reviewed. Thus, F1000Research offers a hybrid model with publicly available
manuscripts at time of submission and standard peer-reviews. Manuscripts are
considered ``accepted'' and will only be indexed after two positive referee
response.

\section{Conclusion}

Responding to the rumour that they refused manuscripts submitted to arXiv,
Nature responded that ``Nature never wishes to stand in the way of communication
between researchers. We seek rather to add value for authors and the community
at large in our peer review, selection and editing'' \cite{nat05}.

Open preprints server offer a great opportunity for open science, especially if
the community embrace the idea of discussing preprints. Initiatives like
Haldane's Sieve (\href{http://haldanessieve.org/}{http://haldanessieve.org/}), a
new blog discussing arXiv papers in population genetics, will help make arXiv
attractive for scientists looking to promote their work. These initiatives are
important to fully exploit the potential of open preprints servers.

Posting preprints online increases the community of available informal
peer reviewers, and uses the internet for its original
community-building purposes.  Preprint servers also facilitate
communication between disciplines, bridging cultural as well as
geographic divides.
% JA: perhaps something less advertising-like should go here:
The advantages are clear and the costs are low.

% Karthik's comments: 
% It would be worthwhile to mention that not everyone is stoked about pre-print servers (crazy people). So maybe cite something to that effect?
