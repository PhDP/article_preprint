Dear Dr. Gross,

  I have consulted my coauthors for a last check on the article and we made a few
small changes to the text:

 - We added "Open" in the title to avoid confusion.
 - The section "Current offerings" was renamed "Preprint server roundup". This
section is now intended to be a box with a table at the beginning and a very
short text for each of the main server.
 - We removed the word "censorship" in the discussion. It was considered too
strong by a few of us.
 - We fixed a few typos.

The text is written with PLOS' LaTeX template and you did not give any
instruction on formatting LaTeX files so I assumed I had no further formatting
to do.

Best regards,
On behalf of the authors,
